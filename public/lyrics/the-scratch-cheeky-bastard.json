{"title":"Cheeky Bastard by The Scratch","lyrics":"He’s got the geansaí and the jean shorts\nWouldn’t be the kind of man that’s handy at sports\nHe’s got a heart of gold\nA ticket never stopped a man from getting bold \n\nNever seen a man knock back Black Russians\nWouldn’t say he thinks about the repercussions \nCouple of sips, quick lip of the lips and he’s piping up \nPiping up\n\nHussey, sing us a song, sing us a song will ya?\nHe won’t stop singing Champagne Supernova\n\nGood luck to ye\nWouldn’t wanna tell this lad he’s had enough\nThose shots are etched in his head man\nAnd his shirt’s on backwards so ye know he’s brown bread man\n\nNever seen a man knock back Black Russians\nWouldn’t say he thinks about the repercussions \nCouple of sips, quick lip of the lips and he’s piping up \nPiping up\n\nHussey, sing us a song, sing us a song will ya\nHe won’t stop singing Champagne Supernova\nHussey, sing us a song, sing us a song will ya?\nHe won’t stop singing Champagne Supernova\n\nPigeon French, a shirt like a beach towel \nShowboating even with your back teeth floating \n\nHussey, sing us a song, sing us a song will ya?\nHe won’t stop singing Champagne Supernova\nHussey, sing us a song, sing us a song will ya?\nHe won’t stop singing Champagne Supernova\n","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSrBmKZaxCo"}
