    "lyrics": "Waking up to your voice, such a pretty noise\nCouldn't believe you didn't wake up with some different boy\nOh, I'm the last pick of all your draft picks\nLining up my words so they're all cleverly crafted\nYou could see right through\nOh, oh\n\nShe thinks that love's this sick little disease that attacks you\nBut I could fall deep in it every day if I had to\nOh, with you it's so easy to\nDrop all those things I had to do\nOh, it's fine, never a waste of my time\n\nI want a love where we stop going to church 'cause it's boring\nAnd sleep in on all those Sunday mornings\nThe sun would creep in through the blinds\nWe would hide underneath the sheets\nTrying to find\nA million ways to kill the time\n\nBut I never really know what you're thinking about\nAnd I know I'll never really figure it out\nAll experience ever does is confirm my doubts\nWasn't convinced that I'd ever really come around\n'Cause it's funny how life goes, you know?\nLike there's just shit I don't need anyone to know\nLike this girl out there somewhere, I don't know\nBut I wonder all the time if she ever misses the snow\n\n\n\nAnd all these thoughts I can't push out of my mind\nLike these visions of a hundred twisted ways I might die\nThe view from there was kinda nice\nAction was kinda slow\nAgain, these are things I don't need anyone to know\n\nOh\nI can't believe I thought I was safe\nIn my most crooked shape\nMost vulnerable place\nAnd all that time I was hanging on your shelf\nI was just running away from getting to know myself",
