    "lyrics": "When there's nothing left to burn\nYou have to set yourself on fire\n\nGod, that was strange to see you again\nIntroduced by a friend of a friend\nSmiled and said, \\\"Yes, I think we've met before,\\\"\nIn that instant it started to pour\n\nCaptured a taxi despite all the rain\nWe drove in silence across Pont Champlain\nAnd all of that time you thought I was sad\nI was trying to remember your name\n\nThis scar is a fleck on my porcelain skin\nTried to reach deep, but you couldn't get in\nNow you're outside me, you see all the beauty\nRepent all your sin\n\nIt's nothing but time and a face that you lose\nI chose to feel it and you couldn't choose\nI'll write you a postcard, I'll send you the news\nFrom the house down the road from real love\n\n\n\nLive through this and you won't look back\nLive through this and you won't look back\nLive through this and you won't look back\n\nThere's one thing I want to say, so I'll be brave:\nYou were what I wanted, I gave what I gave\nI'm not sorry I met you, I'm not sorry it's over\nI'm not sorry there's nothing to save\nI'm not sorry there's nothing to save",
