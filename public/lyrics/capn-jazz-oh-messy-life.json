    "lyrics": "Fire is motion\nWork is repetition\nThis is my document\nWe are all, all we've done\nWe are all, all we've done\nWe are all, all we've done\nWe are all, all defenses\nFire is motion, is motion growth?\n\nAnd you are colder than oldness\nCould ever be\nAnd you are bolder\nThan buzzing bugs\nAnd you are colder than oldness\nCould ever be\nAnd you are bolder\nThan buzzing bugs\n\nMy mama, my my mama said\nMy cousin Bucky's so boldly bald\nMy cousin Bucky never took his hat off\nHe always kept his hair back\nMy cousin Bucky kept his hair back\nHe kept that cap on\nEven when swimming\nYeah, I know there's a lesson\nIn there somewhere\nSomething nothing\nSpecial about boys\nWho smell like salami\nAnd boys who've never apologized\n\n\n\nAnd you are colder than oldness\nCould ever be\nAnd you are bolder\nThan buzzing bugs",
