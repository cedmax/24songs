    "lyrics": "Oh how you've darl'd me\nThough no cause for concern\nIn season, you impart me\nDescending Clovers that I yearn\nOur better steps held true\nAs lesser ends felt too\nIt's so much nicer being lost in you\n\nWhere my lips come unsealed\nWhere my head comes clear\nHow I know that you hear me\n\nThe ways that I could love you\nThe ways that I'll let go\nYou said it'd take getting used to\nI said I'd like getting to know\n\nWisteria in bloom\nWhere do you twine up to?\nYou said it'd take getting used to\nWhy can I say?\n\nYou said it looked lovely\nMy unwell shade of blue\nNo matter how rich your soil\nI still flinched at the roots\n\n\n\nSorry if I'm keeping you up\nKills me to see your eyes so befallen\nSorry if I'm keeping you up\nIt won't be the last time\nSorry I've been keeping you up\nEach waking hour must be more than your bargained\nI'm sorry I've been keeping you out\nJust can't bear this to be how your eyes remember me\n\nNew place, same old\nSplit hairs, split seams, split ends\nNew place, same old\n\nShould my lips stay sealed\nCould my thoughts be more clear?\nShould I hope that you hear me?\nDon't I wish you were here?\nShould my lips stay sealed\nCould my thoughts be more clear\nHow I hope that you hear me?\n\nThe ways I've wished to love you\nThe ways that I've let go\nWhen you say it like we used to\nWhat can I say?\n\n\n\nSorry I've been keeping you up\nIt won't be the last time\nSorry I've been keeping you out\nJust can't bear this to be\nAll your eyes should find left of me\n\nWisteria in bloom\nWhere do you grow off to?\nYou say it’s what you’re used to\nWhat I've said\nOh, what I've said!",
