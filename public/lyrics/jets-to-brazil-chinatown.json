    "lyrics": "Candle is blue, could see me through, I'm colorblind\nThey tell me it's blue, I'm a believer, that's why I'm blind\nLive on the freeway, listen to signs, and we drive by feel\nBe a believer, believe everything, you'll be right half the time\n\nCandle is waxing, takes my apartment, I bask in its magic\nAll of the firefighters put out my fires, took all my matches\nStaying up later, waking up old, and I'm leaving her never\nOrdering in, all friends and lovers\nAnd we're making our weather with a lone light bulb\n\nI'm tired of fighting, so I'm demolished, that's the way\nSome make exhaustion a mode of expression and that's their way\nI'm just a question knowing my answer, hope I'm wrong\nI know the answer, it's four in the morning, I'm right again\nI'm Chinatown\n\nNow in a hurry, rubbing up urgent to get home to dot\nWas my missed mistress, messed up my mattress, I missed the catch\nLast of the pitchers, catfish done hunting, Harry Lundt\nMost of the killers never get famous and it's hard on everyone\n\n\n\nI'm tired of fighting\nI'm tired of fighting\nI'm tired of fighting\nI'm tired of fighting\n\nI'm tired of fighting, so I'm demolished, that's the way\nSome make exhaustion a mode of expression and that's their way\nI'm just a question knowing my answer, hope I'm wrong\nI know the answer, it's four in the morning, I'm right again\nI'm Chinatown",
