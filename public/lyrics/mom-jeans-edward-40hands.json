    "lyrics": "Sorry, it's just, people are complaining (Too bad)\nYou know, they want to know if you guys can maybe try tuning up again? Or- (No)\n...play on beat and just do it right? (No) All right\nLet's stop foolin' around and turn this band into a lean, mean, mom jeans revenge machine (Yeah)\nMom Jeans\n\nWhat do you want me to say?\nIt's never going away\n'Cause I'm stuck on you like the smell\nOf cigarettes on your flower dress\n\nI want you under my fingernails\nI want you in my sleep and in my dreams\nI wake up spooning my pillow\nSweaty hands, but please don't tell your friends\n\nNow I'm addicted to cigarettes\nAt first I didn't let myself inhale\nBut smoke got through and so did you\nAnd now every burn hole smells like home\n\nAnd I know it's killing me\nBut that still won't stop me\n'Cause now we smell the same\nBut you still kill me faster\n\n\n\nI don't mind that you lie sometimes\nBecause I lie too, guess I'm just like you\nI don't mind that you lie sometimes\nBecause I lie too, guess I'm just like you\n\n\nI don't mind that you lie sometimes\nBecause I lie too, guess I'm just like you\nI don't mind that you lie sometimes\nBecause I lie too, guess I'm just like you\n\n\nI don't mind\nThat you lie sometimes\nBecause I lie too\nGuess I'm just like you",
