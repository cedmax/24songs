    "lyrics": "Lets take the dark road to the far side of the station\nCan you stop complaining about your lies yesterday\nI don't know where you've been but I can see the tension\nAre we gonna crumble through the cracks that we share?\n\nDon't you know, that you're living a lie\nDon't you know, that you're wasting my time\nMake it worth it, can you stay for the night?\nAll I want is to be perfectly fine\n\nI can feel it the air that you breathe\nThe silence, it haunts me\nCan't you see that I don't want you to leave?\nSo...\n\nLets take the long road and forget where were going\nLiving dreams through echos, conversations in my head\nI don't know where you've been\nAlways searching through this mess\nAre we gonna crumble through the cracks that we share?\n\nDon't you know, that you're living a lie\nDon't you know, that you're wasting my time\nMake it worth it, can you stay for the night?\nAll I want is to be perfectly fine\n\n\n\nOnly you can hurt me\nOnly you can help me fly\n\nI can feel it the air that you breathe\nThe silence, it haunts me\nI can feel it the air that you breathe\nThe silence, it haunts me\nCan't you see that i don't want you to leave\n\nI can feel it the air that you breathe\nThe silence, it haunts me\nCan't you see that I don't want you to leave\nGo",
