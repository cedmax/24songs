    "lyrics": "Lately, it's been getting late but I'm not tired\nAnd no thanks to\nSleepless nights spent burning with desire\nSo I'll get in my car\n\nWe drove to the shoreline with the check engine light on\nWe slept in a spare room, sparing no thoughts for our friends\nAnd we're all going straight to hell for all the lies we tell ourselves\n\nLast night\nLast night, I wanted to leave all my friends out\nDesperate chance dragged me out of the sand\nBut chance's a certain way of getting stuck\nOn one small desperate action robbed me of all my good luck\nWhy did I think I could make it better now?\nWhy did I think I could keep my feet on the ground?\n\nIf I wake up and accidentally crawl into your arms\nIt's nothing personal, personhood has always seemed so strange\nWhy do things always have to go and change?\nBe better off if things just stayed the same\nIf I freak out and crash my fucking car into your house\nOf course it's personal, personhood has made me feel this way\nWhy do things always have to go and change?\nBe better off if things just stayed the same\n\n\n\nI'm getting too old for this shit\nI'm throwing fists and acting like a kid again",
