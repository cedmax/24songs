{"title":"Dust on Trial by Shame","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI'll always be here\nTo hear your words\nAnd give you everything\nThat you deserve\nI'll always be here\nTo hold your hand\nAnd walk you to\nThe promised land\nWill you walk this land with me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd what's the point of talking\nIf all your words have been said?\nWhen a world can crumble\nAnd the soil leaks red\nA land of pure confusion\nKnown only to the wise\nWhere satisfaction is devoured\nDominated and despised\n\n[Outro]\nJust\nOne\nStep\nCloser to me\nCloser to me\nCloser to me\nCloser to me\nCloser and closer and closer\nCloser and closer and closer\nCloser and closer and closer\nCloser and closer and closer\nCloser to me","url":"https://genius.com/Shame-dust-on-trial-lyrics"}
