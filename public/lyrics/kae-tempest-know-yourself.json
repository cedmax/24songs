    "lyrics": "If you saw the younger you, what would you say to 'em?\nI would say thanks\nI would say peace\nI'd tell them, \\\"Soon child, you are gonna find release\\\"\n(Release, release, release)\n\nLong time coming to right now, pipe down\nLifetime looking for things I thought I'd found already\nFalling to the floor, like I'm alright, I'm steady\nI send myself back so I can tell me\nTwenty years deep in the rhymes and beats\nAnd I'm still so far from finding peace\nEvery line is a ladder I can climb through timе\nAnd I walk straight faced through these winding streets\nI еat the bread of rhythm, I drink the milk of rhyme\nI've been carrying a bag of shame that's bigger than me\nDragging it behind me, up an endless staircase\nUntil the day I realised\nThis doesn't mean what I think it does\nI don't need to carry this forever\nI left it in the clearing by the fire pit and ran\nBack to the child I was, looking for an elder\nI saw myself there, I took myself by the hand\n\n\n\nWhen I was young, I sought help from my older self\nI came into my head, I told me know yourself\nWhen I was young, I sought help from my older self\nI came into my head, I told me know yourself\n(Self, self, self, self)\n\nI was seventeen, heaven seemed close enough to touch\nI had never been happier, chest against the barrier\nWatching Wu-Tang\nMy own character starting to bloom\nI was learning how to capture a room in two phrases\nTwenty years deep in the rhymes and beats\nClose my eyes and speak down the wires of time\nI go back to the child I was\nWhen I put myself on the line\nI had to beg for the mic, I had to deal with the ignorance\nHad to get better, I wanted bigger things\nThese days, those days they are far away\nTry and catch them in my sights but they start to fade\nNow I sit amongst crate loads of rhyme books\nAnd I think about the days that the time took\nI thank the little me that put the work in\nLike, could you picture me when you were spitting sixteens?\nSurfing the top deck penning them bars\nUnderaged in the clubs taking charge of the mic\nPrecautious little nothing with the world in his sights\nI am on it now, I will work harder\nThis is peace to the kid I came after\n(Peace to the kid I came after)\nThe words of the bridge between the present and the past\nI know myself at last\n\n\n\nWhen I was young, I sought help from my older self\nI came into my head, I told me know yourself\nWhen I was young, I sought help from my older self\nI came into my head, I told me know yourself\nKnow yourself\nKnow yourself\n\nSoon child, you are gonna find release\n(Release, release)",
