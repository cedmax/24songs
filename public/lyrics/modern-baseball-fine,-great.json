    "lyrics": "The opening track from Modern Baseball’s sophomore LP You’re Gonna Miss It All.I hate worrying about the future\n'Cause all my current problems are based around the past\nAnd I hate when you call me late at night\nJust to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about\nBut it's all right, and I'm okay\nI won't need your help, anyway, ah, well\nI hate having to think about my future\nWhen all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me\n\nI'm so tired, or maybe just bored\nI can't really tell the difference whenever I'm talking to you\nAnd I know that you just adore\nStarting off with me, that way that there's no way that I'll assume\nThat you're wasting all of my time\nTo vent about your problems like how your Instagram stopped working\nAnd how your friends bailed on you\nBut it was funny 'cause it was the day you were supposed to hang with me\n(Yeah, about that)\n\nI'm guilty as charged for leading you on\nA lie that I know is easy to see\nBut it's crucial to blot out any\nSigns that I might have feelings\nThis way, you don't ask me \\\"how am I?\\\"\nThis way you won't force me to proceed\nWith actually having to tell you my worries\nWith actually having you give a damn about me\nYou giving a damn about\n\n\n\nI hate worrying about the future\n'Cause all my fucking problems are based around the past\nAnd I hate when you call me late at night\nJust to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about\nBut it's alright, and I'm okay\nI won't need your help, anyway, ah, well\nI hate having to think about my future\nWhen all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me",
