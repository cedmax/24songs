    "lyrics": "\\\"Look, these teachers...these teachers want us to work, you know? And I say fine...I'll work. But you gotta let me do the kind of work that I wanna do. And for me, Lindsay, it's my- it's my drum kit, man. This my passion, you know? This is- this is the essence of who I am now. But before I had this, I was lost too. You see what I'm saying? You need to find...your reason for- for living, man. You've got to find, your big, just gigantic drum kit, you know?\\\"\n\\\"Hey, maybe I'll buy a clarinet\\\"\n\nI'm no good with maps\nI've no sense of direction\nAnd I can't write anything without autocorrection\nI just can't keep up with this curriculum\nI wish I could learn in my sleep\nI've got a problem with problems\nI'm not punctual\nI get lost in context and sentence construction\nI've never said this to anyone before\nI've never said it out loud",
