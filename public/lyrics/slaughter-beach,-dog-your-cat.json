    "lyrics": "She smoked 100s when I met her\nShe tried to quit before she left me\nI'm not so sure if that's important\nFree association gets me dizzy\nThey ask, \\\"What's the reason for your appointment?\\\"\nI try to come up with something vague\nShe asks if I'm going to the party\nI tell her I'm going to the party\n\nIt's so hot by noon, I just get queasy\nIt's so hot by two, I stay inside\nI try to put down a cup of coffee\nHe asks how much I'm drinking, and I lie\nBut doctors are always trying to tell you\nSome torturous way to live your life\nIt's not like they know everything ever\nHey, man, I went to college, too, ooh, ooh\n\n\nBut all of the kids I met on campus\nAre settled down beside the sea\nSome days, I wish that I could be that\nSometimes, I forget to spit out the seeds\nI'll make it through this if it kills me\nThen, when it kills me, I'll come back\nJesus will make me a disciple\nOr maybe he'll let me be your cat\n\n\n\nI wait to be led into temptation\nAs I lay a load across the street\nCatherine is smoking pot above me\nWatching Hellraiser on TV\nTomorrow, I'm driving to Chicago\nTonight, I am kneeling from the pew\nStill doing all I can to understand\nOne more erotic nightmare about you",
