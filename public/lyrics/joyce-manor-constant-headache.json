    "lyrics": "I could hear you coming, so I hid by the couch\nYou were talking so loudly, I don't know what about\nBut you were drunker than high school, self-conscious and sweet\nI never ever felt so cool disguised in your sheets\n\nBut I'm a constant headache, a tooth out of line\nThey try to make you regret it\nYou tell 'em, \\\"No, not this time.\\\"\nI'm just a constant headache, a dead pet device\nYou hang me up unfinished\nWith the better part of me no longer mine\n\nAnd then you finally found me, pretending to sleep\nYou said such nice things about me, I felt guilty and cheap\nYou took two steps to the kitchen and just stared at the sink\nI couldn't hold back a smile, I still wish I could have seen\nYou having sex in the morning, your love was foreign to me\nIt made me think maybe human's not such a bad thing to be\nBut I just laid there in protest, entirely fucked\nIt's such a stubborn reminder one perfect night's not enough\n\nIt's just a constant headache, a tooth out of line\nThey try to make you regret it\nYou tell 'em, \\\"No, not this time.\\\"\nIt's just a constant headache, a dead pet device\nYou hang me up unfinished\nWith the better part of me no longer mine",
